Professor Yusuf Ali, SAN, indeed is deserving of this title as he is a person with great knowledge of the law and whose personal efforts have seen him rise to the peak of the legal profession, both in practice and in the academics. His knowledge is also being used to advance society. As a great friend of Kwara State University, Professor Yusuf’s contributions to our law faculty and the institution have written his name in gold. On behalf of the Council, Management, staff, and students of Kwara State University, I warmly congratulate the Kuliyan Ngeri of Ilorin, Professor Yusuf Ola-Olu Ali, SAN, and wish him good health and long life with which to add more value to humankind.
