The Acting Vice-Chancellor, Professor Shaykh-Luqman Jimoh while presenting the bus to the Kwara State Governor, Mallam AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq on Thursday, August 24, 2023 at the State Government House in Ilorin said the University was constantly in tune with realities in the society through the innovation of products and ideas to support the vision of the State Government to advance the lives of the peoples. Prof Jimoh added that the bus was conceptualised and designed with realities of electricity supply in the country, which made the bus more efficient and effective. The Governor who was visibly excited, described the innovation as \u201ca clear indication that we are fast turning the corners as our country steadily joins the world to reduce over reliance on fossil fuel and adopt cleaner energy\u201d. Mallam AbdulRahman noted that the innovation was coming at an excellent time, especially when governments at all levels within the country were making different efforts to ease the challenges brought by the removal of subsidy on petrol. He commended the management of the University and the team of engineers led by the Head of Technical Unit of the Centre for Sustainable Energy and Chief Technologist at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, AbdulAzeez Akande for expediting the realisation of the electric bus.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4650, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ec551f2-470e-44b8-8665-6625466c8fed": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ec551f2-470e-44b8-8665-6625466c8fed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "temp_documents.txt", "file_name": "temp_documents.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 120172, "creation_date": "2025-01-14", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2c10dc8b-37ac-4358-822c-1a9bb8005560", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "temp_documents.txt", "file_name": "temp_documents.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 120172, "creation_date": "2025-01-14", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-15"}, "hash": "67e5c91e4d3bc0e1bc443cb6a8fea80de1585a7df7f0dd8c2a98e229b5fd7bd2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ad16ea2a-e92f-4cb8-9e4e-f1ea8ff7ee92", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "temp_documents.txt", "file_name": "temp_documents.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 120172, "creation_date": "2025-01-14", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-15"}, "hash": "9a882ad976f2395d93f200589fba0135751560aaa9cc09d0ba4207d2dc48d503", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "477d5c0b-f03f-45d3-9666-98ba284c0c87", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6ffa81a135bfd1add5f06f19773712283a54c149d1a5de0565638dd1d53b9a85", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Prof Jimoh added that the bus was conceptualised and designed with realities of electricity supply in the country, which made the bus more efficient and effective.

The office was headed by Mrs. Hawa Kamaldeen (then an Asst. Reg.) at inception. She served as the coordinator of the office alongside two other supporting staff. Together, they set the pace and were actively involved in cementing a veritable and healthy relationship between the alumni and Kwara State University. Every year, graduating students fill alumni registration form, which is used to build the alumni database. Recently though, the registration is being done electronically to accommodate all alumni where ever they are. Social media pages have also been created for regular engagements and interactions with the alumni, thus strengthening relationship with all concerned. The Alumni Relations Unit is very germane to the running of a university. What do they do? The Unit is charged with the responsibility of \u2018selling memories\u2019 and ensuring the sustenance of thorough bonding between alumni and the university. The more memories we sell, the more students\u2019 experiences we enrich. It is believed that a student with rich and memorable experience from admission to graduation will give back to his/her alma mater with great pleasure. It gives me great pleasure to welcome our esteemed alumni, most cordially, to this beautiful forum that serves as a major information platform for KWASU Alumni. This was conceptualized and developed to have a platform that will serve as a potpourri of ideas between the university and our great alumni. You will agree with me that Kwara State University is an enigma among its peers. It is a beautiful university; a fulcrum of knowledge and character that is steadily threading the path of becoming a world-class university. As a relatively nascent institution, it is equally ready to positively dare. This is the culmination of an enormous collective effort of its founding fathers in their quest to provide a world-class university for our citizens.

Since 2009, KWASU has enjoyed an uninterrupted academic calendar. This great institution has molded characters and forged individuals with fantastic academic records that have made our alumni compete favorably in the labor market and contribute their quota to socio-economic developments, both locally and internationally. The Alumni Relations Unit which was established in 2013, has been experiencing an exponential increase in the number of alumni out there. They are everywhere in the globe, making waves in different sectors, helping build the economy, and making the institution proud through their credible, creative, daring, and impressive contributions, in their bid to make positive change in the world we live in. Through this forum, our great alumni should volunteer themselves for the growth and development of this institution. They should also see themselves as the fulcrum of resourceful and purposeful bonding. Through this, a lifelong relationship between them and the university could be sustained. Distinguished alumni, it is on this note that I, on behalf of the management, wish you all, fruitful endeavors that will make KWASU and the entire nation proud.\r\nThank you and God bless.

Professor Abdul Kabir Hussain SolihuDean, Faculty of Arts The Faculty of Arts, formally known as the College of Humanities, Management and Social Sciences, is one of the six pioneer colleges at the inception of the University in 2009. It was under late Professor Francis Abiola Irele who served as the pioneer Provost from 2009 to 2014, and later by Professor Sakah Mahmud as the second Provost between 2014 and 2019. The current Dean of the faculty is Professor Abdul Kabir Hussain Solihu from 2019 till date and Dr. Aliyu Okuta Ahmad as Sub-Dean from 2020 till date. Following the University\u2019s decision to change from a collegiate management system to a faculty management system in 2020, the college was renamed the Faculty of Humanities, Management and Social Sciences. Over the last 14 years, it has continued to grow and thrive to become the largest faculty in the University in terms of student enrollment and number of academic staff, with 21 accredited undergraduate programmes. In June 2023, the faculty was split into the Faculty of Arts and Faculty of Management and Social Sciences.\u00a0 Several staff in the faculty are currently holding critical administrative positions in the university. These include the Dean of the School of Postgraduate Studies, Dean of Student Affairs, Director of the Centre for Archives and Documentation, Director of University Relations, Director of Affiliation and Linkages, Director of the Centre for Advance and Basic Studies, and most importantly the Acting Vice Chancellor of the university.\u00a0 The Faculty of Arts offers programmes guided by the philosophy of creating and developing responsible global citizens who play their role in community development and nation-building.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 38462, "end_char_idx": 43322, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "79dd8c36-457b-45b7-916a-6bf6481d6e4c": {"__data__": {"id_": "79dd8c36-457b-45b7-916a-6bf6481d6e4c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "temp_documents.txt", "file_name": "temp_documents.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 120172, "creation_date": "2025-01-14", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2c10dc8b-37ac-4358-822c-1a9bb8005560", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "temp_documents.txt", "file_name": "temp_documents.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 120172, "creation_date": "2025-01-14", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-15"}, "hash": "67e5c91e4d3bc0e1bc443cb6a8fea80de1585a7df7f0dd8c2a98e229b5fd7bd2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "29e11817-4c72-40fe-8f7b-c8fd0351a29b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "temp_documents.txt", "file_name": "temp_documents.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 120172, "creation_date": "2025-01-14", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-15"}, "hash": "0c97484fdc357177a4e98119b2013e6c3ebdf2133ffca9a88a85d426298f126f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d6c3b25b-3049-474f-af22-4b519241953d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9b4d0655272315e5c5321c496c053beecc8853ce97500bfd87450150ed0daab6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Over the last 14 years, it has continued to grow and thrive to become the largest faculty in the University in terms of student enrollment and number of academic staff, with 21 accredited undergraduate programmes.

Dr. Shehu Usman AdamDean, Faculty of Management and Social SciencesKwara State University, Malete. The Faculty of Management and Social Sciences (FMSS) at Kwara State University, Malete, has a rich and storied history that reflects our commitment to academic excellence and societal impact. FMSS was founded with the vision of becoming a leading faculty in Management and Social Sciences education and research. In a significant development, our new journey began when the faculty was established as part of the defunct Faculty of Humanities, Management and Social Sciences (HMSS) which was one of the founding faculties at the inception of the university in 2009. FMSS emerged as a distinct faculty in 2023, following the unbundling of HMSS into FMSS and Faculty of Arts, orchestrated by the expansion of the hitherto existent faculty of HMSS both in terms of enrolment and degree programmes. This milestone marked a new chapter in our journey, allowing us to focus more intently on our core disciplines and to better serve our students and the broader community.Since our inception, FMSS has provided high-quality education, conducting cutting-edge research, and engaging with our communities to address real-world challenges. We take pride in our commitment to producing graduates who are not only academically proficient but also socially responsible, creative, and equipped to make a meaningful impact on society. As we continue to evolve and grow, we remain steadfast in our dedication to excellence, innovation, and the pursuit of knowledge. We look forward to a future filled with continued achievements, impactful research, and the success of our students and faculty members. Thank you for being part of our journey, and we invite you to explore FMSS at Kwara State University, Malete, as we continue to expand horizons through collaborations, foster critical thinking, and shape a brighter future.

At the undergraduate level, our goal is to provide the best and the brightest students with an interdisciplinary education, while preparing them for future leadership and success in the game of life. Every undergraduate student will be required to engage in community service (COBEP) and industrial attachment that will prepare them to work in the real world and proffer engineering solutions to community-based problems during the weeks of interaction.\u00a0 Furthermore, the students will be required to undertake a two-semester-long final-year project that will develop their research competencies. Experienced and quality academic staff of the faculty are committed to innovative research that has an impact on society. Thus, they have impacted our alumni at both bachelor and post-bachelor degrees and these alumni are doing well in their chosen specialties. Therefore, a warm welcome is extended to all undergraduate and postgraduate students, industrial partners, ministries, departments, agencies of government, and international organizations.
